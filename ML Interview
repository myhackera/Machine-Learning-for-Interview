1.) ML vs DL vs AI
====================>>>>>

AI
---

  AI is basically the study of training your machine(computers) to mimic a human brain and it’s thinking capabilities”. AI focuses on 3 major aspects(skills): learning, reasoning and self-correction to obtain maximum efficiency possible.
  AI is the broader family consisting of ML and DL as it’s components.
  AI is a computer algorithm which exhibits intelligence through decision making.
  The aim is to basically increase chances of success and not accuracy.
  Three broad categories/types Of AI are: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
  The efficiency Of AI is basically the efficiency provided by ML and DL respectively.
  Examples of AI applications include: Google’s AI-Powered Predictions, Ridesharing Apps Like Uber and Lyft, Commercial Flights Use an AI Autopilot, etc.
  
ML
---

  The major aim of ML is to allow the systems to learn by themselves through the experience without any kind of human intervention or assistance.
  ML is an application or subset of AI.
  ML is an AI algorithm which allows system to learn from data.
  The aim is to increase accuracy not caring much about the success ratio.
  Three broad categories/types Of ML are: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
  Less efficient than DL as it can’t work for longer dimensions or higher amount of data.
  Examples of ML applications include: Virtual Personal Assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google, etc., Email Spam and Malware Filtering.
   
DL
---
  Deep Learning is basically a sub-part of the broader family of Machine Learning which makes use of Neural Networks(similar to the neurons working in our brain) to mimic human brain-like behavior.
  DL is the subset of ML
  DL is a ML algorithm that uses deep(more than one layer) neural networks to analyze data and provide output accordingly.
  It attains the highest rank in terms of accuracy when it is trained with large amount of data.
  DL can be considered as neural networks with a large number of parameters layers lying in one of the four fundamental network architectures: Unsupervised Pre-trained Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Recursive Neural Networks.
  More powerful than ML as it can easily work for larger sets of data.
  Examples of DL applications include: Sentiment based news aggregation, Image analysis and caption generation, etc.
  
2.) Supervised VS Unsupervised Learning
=======================================>>>

  Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data.
  Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained using unlabeled data.

  Supervised learning model takes direct feedback to check if it is predicting correct output or not.
  Unsupervised learning model does not take any feedback.

  Supervised learning model predicts the output.
  Unsupervised learning model finds the hidden patterns in data.

  In supervised learning, input data is provided to the model along with the output.
  In unsupervised learning, only input data is provided to the model.

  The goal of supervised learning is to train the model so that it can predict the output when it is given new data.
  The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the hidden patterns and useful insights from the unknown dataset.

  Supervised learning needs supervision to train the model.	
  Unsupervised learning does not need any supervision to train the model.

  Supervised learning can be categorized in Classification and Regression problems.
  Unsupervised Learning can be classified in Clustering and Associations problems.

  Supervised learning can be used for those cases where we know the input as well as corresponding outputs.	
  Unsupervised learning can be used for those cases where we have only input data and no corresponding output data.

  Supervised learning model produces an accurate result.
  Unsupervised learning model may give less accurate result as compared to supervised learning.

  Supervised learning is not close to true Artificial intelligence as in this, we first train the model for each data, and then only it can predict the correct output.
  Unsupervised learning is more close to the true Artificial Intelligence as it learns similarly as a child learns daily routine things by his experiences.

  It includes various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Multi-class Classification, Decision tree, Bayesian Logic, etc.
  It includes various algorithms such as Clustering, KNN, and Apriori algorithm.
  
3.) Reinforcement Learning
==========================>>>

  Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. 
  It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. 
  It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. 
  Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience. 
  
4.) Regression and Classification
==================================>>>

  Regression and Classification algorithms are Supervised Learning algorithms. Both the algorithms are used for prediction in Machine learning and work with the labeled datasets. But the difference between both is how they are used for different machine learning problems.

  The main difference between Regression and Classification algorithms that Regression algorithms are used to predict the continuous values such as price, salary, age, etc. and Classification algorithms are used to predict/Classify the discrete values such as Male or Female, True or False, Spam or Not Spam, etc.
  
  Regression algorithms can be used to solve the regression problems such as Weather Prediction, House price prediction, etc.
  Classification Algorithms can be used to solve classification problems such as Identification of spam emails, Speech Recognition, Identification of cancer cells, etc.

  Types of ML Classification Algorithms:
  Classification Algorithms can be further divided into the following types:

  > Logistic Regression
  > K-Nearest Neighbours
  > Support Vector Machines
  > Kernel SVM
  > Naïve Bayes
  > Decision Tree Classification
  > Random Forest Classification
  
  Types of Regression Algorithm:

  > Simple Linear Regression
  > Multiple Linear Regression
  > Polynomial Regression
  > Support Vector Regression
  > Decision Tree Regression
  > Random Forest Regression
  
5.) Clustering
===============>>>
  
  Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them. 
  
6.) Bias and Variance
======================>>>
https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/bias-and-variance

  Bias: Assumptions made by a model to make a function easier to learn. It is actually the error rate of the training data. When the error rate has a high value, we call it High Bias and when the error rate has a low value, we call it low Bias.
  Variance:  The error rate of the testing data is called variance. When the error rate has a high value, we call it High variance and when the error rate has a low value, we call it Low variance.
