1.) ML vs DL vs AI
====================>>>>>

AI
---

  AI is basically the study of training your machine(computers) to mimic a human brain and it’s thinking capabilities”. AI focuses on 3 major aspects(skills): learning, reasoning and self-correction to obtain maximum efficiency possible.
  AI is the broader family consisting of ML and DL as it’s components.
  AI is a computer algorithm which exhibits intelligence through decision making.
  The aim is to basically increase chances of success and not accuracy.
  Three broad categories/types Of AI are: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
  The efficiency Of AI is basically the efficiency provided by ML and DL respectively.
  Examples of AI applications include: Google’s AI-Powered Predictions, Ridesharing Apps Like Uber and Lyft, Commercial Flights Use an AI Autopilot, etc.
  
ML
---

  The major aim of ML is to allow the systems to learn by themselves through the experience without any kind of human intervention or assistance.
  ML is an application or subset of AI.
  ML is an AI algorithm which allows system to learn from data.
  The aim is to increase accuracy not caring much about the success ratio.
  Three broad categories/types Of ML are: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
  Less efficient than DL as it can’t work for longer dimensions or higher amount of data.
  Examples of ML applications include: Virtual Personal Assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google, etc., Email Spam and Malware Filtering.
   
DL
---
  Deep Learning is basically a sub-part of the broader family of Machine Learning which makes use of Neural Networks(similar to the neurons working in our brain) to mimic human brain-like behavior.
  DL is the subset of ML
  DL is a ML algorithm that uses deep(more than one layer) neural networks to analyze data and provide output accordingly.
  It attains the highest rank in terms of accuracy when it is trained with large amount of data.
  DL can be considered as neural networks with a large number of parameters layers lying in one of the four fundamental network architectures: Unsupervised Pre-trained Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Recursive Neural Networks.
  More powerful than ML as it can easily work for larger sets of data.
  Examples of DL applications include: Sentiment based news aggregation, Image analysis and caption generation, etc.
